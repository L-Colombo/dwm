# Lorenzo Colombo - SUCKLESS'S DYNAMIC WINDOW MANAGER

This is my build of Suckless's [Dynamic Window Manager](https://dwm.suckless.org) (DWM).
DWM is a very fast and minimal window manager built for the X window system.

## Features

My build is, for my use-cases, feature complete.
Unfortunately, I added the patches that I needed without keeping track of them, but the behaviors triggered by the keybinding in the `config.def.h` can give a pretty satisfying idea of the patches that I have applied.

## Build

TO build it suffices to clone the repository, navigate to the directory and run `make && sudo make install`.
